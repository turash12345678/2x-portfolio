# User Context Instruction Validation Report

**File:** `usercontexts/sample_usercontext.instructions.md`
**Validated:** 2026-09-06
**Spec Version:** v1.5.0
**Validator:** `skills/validate-usercontext-instructions`

---

## Overall Status + Compliance Score
- **Status:** PASS
- **Compliance Score:** 100/100

---

## Phase 1: YAML Frontmatter
**Status:** PASS

### Findings
- Valid YAML frontmatter detected.
- Required attributes `description` and `applyTo` are present.
- `spec_version: "1.5.0"` is present and current — no version warning.
- No unsupported frontmatter attributes detected.

### Recommendations
- None.

---

## Phase 2: Required Sections
**Status:** PASS

### Findings
- All required sections are present and ordered consistently.
- Heading levels are coherent and readable.
- Sections are substantive and not placeholder-only.
- Illustrative-example notice is prominently placed at the top of the document body.

### Recommendations
- None.

---

## Phase 3: Content Completeness
**Status:** PASS

### Findings
- Professional background includes role (Senior iOS Developer), location/timezone (Toronto, EST), primary focus (SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, offline-first), and ecosystem (Apple only).
- Technical expertise documents primary language (Swift), frameworks, tooling (Xcode, Instruments, Fastlane, GitHub Actions), architecture preferences, explicit technology exclusions, and active learning trajectory.
- Explicit technology exclusions are specific and justified (no Combine/RxSwift, no UIKit for new code, no SwiftData in production, no third-party networking libraries, avoids SPM dependencies without justification).
- Three current projects with realistic, non-idealized statuses: Fieldwork (beta, ship slipped due to offline sync conflict bugs), Lumen (on hold, client took priority), LogiRoute (NDA, winding down).
- Professional goals and current focus are documented with short-term targets and a Q1 2026 focus area.
- Working style, session state defaults, format preferences, quality standards, communication style, and constraints are all complete and actionable.
- Exclusions and prohibitions section explicitly lists anti-patterns to avoid (God objects, massive ViewModels, Singleton state).

### Recommendations
- None.

---

## Phase 4: Format & Quality
**Status:** PASS

### Findings
- Markdown structure is consistent and scannable.
- Privacy boundaries are appropriate for a public sample artifact; NDA client data is kept generic.
- JSON metadata block is present and structurally valid, matching the markdown section content.
- Illustrative persona (Jordan Kim) is clearly labeled as fictional at both the frontmatter level and in the document body — no risk of being mistaken for real personal data.

### Recommendations
- None.

---

## Phase 5: Spec Compliance
**Status:** PASS

### Findings
- Instruction-based architecture is explicit (WHO/WHAT/HOW) — assistant is told who Jordan Kim is, what the working constraints are, and how to behave in sessions.
- Provider-neutral and portable wording is preserved throughout.
- Content is complete for context-aware collaboration use across hosted, local, and API-based runtimes.
- `spec_version: "1.5.0"` is present in YAML frontmatter, meeting the stamping requirement introduced in spec v1.3.1.
- Session state defaults (role, phase, output style, tone, interaction mode) are explicitly defined.

### Recommendations
- None.

---

## Summary (Strengths/Critical/Warnings/Enhancements)

### Strengths
- Highly specific technical profile with opinionated, justified constraints — demonstrates real-world specificity that generic samples lack.
- Non-idealized project statuses (slipped ship dates, projects on hold, NDA scope) make the sample more instructive for real users.
- Full coverage across all required sections with no placeholder content.
- `spec_version` field present — validation tooling can detect files created before the stamping requirement.
- Clear fictional labeling prevents privacy concerns while maximizing instructive value.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
- None.

### Enhancements (Optional)
- None.

---

## Recommendations (Immediate + Suggested + Migration Path when relevant)

### Immediate
1. No blocking changes required.

### Suggested
1. Re-run validation whenever the canonical usercontext template or spec version changes.

### Migration Path (when relevant)
1. Not applicable; artifact is aligned with spec v1.5.0.
