# AI Context Kit

> **Author:** Marco Siccardi (MSiccDev Software Development)  
> **Purpose:** An AGENTS-first, skills-first framework for maintaining consistent, context-aware AI collaboration across different LLM providers, projects, and development phases.



## Overview

This repository provides a **comprehensive AGENTS-first context and workflow system** designed to enable consistent, context-aware AI collaboration across multiple projects and platforms.

## Primary Agent Entrypoint

- Root `AGENTS.md` is the primary operational entrypoint for agents in this repository.
- `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md` is the normative source of truth for the full session model.
- `docs/spec-rationale.md` is the companion document with background reasoning, extended examples, and future enhancement notes.

### The Evolution

What began as a way to extract and reuse prompts across AI providers has evolved into a sophisticated architecture for AI collaboration:

- **Layered architecture** – Personal user context + project `AGENTS.md` context create complete AI workspace configurations
- **Skill-based workflows** – Create and validate context files using reusable skills with detailed operational logic
- **Provider-agnostic** – Designed to work across different LLM environments; results may vary by platform

### The System

This framework consists of:
- **Personal user context artifacts** – Your professional identity, skills, preferences, and working style
- **Project-specific `AGENTS.md` context** – Scope, tech stack, roles, objectives, and operational guidance per project
- **Skill workflows in `skills/`** – Canonical create/validate/governance operational logic
- **Session specification** – How AI assistants should maintain and adapt context during work sessions
- **Templates in `templates/`** – Canonical artifact structures aligned to the spec

All components are designed to work across hosted and local LLM environments, ensuring that every AI assistant understands your background, working style, and project context without repeated explanations. You may need to adjust your context files for specific platforms.

## See It In Action

The same question, with and without AI Context Kit loaded:

**Without AI Context Kit:**
> User: "Help me add authentication to the app."
>
> AI: "Sure! What framework are you using? What kind of auth — OAuth, JWT, sessions? What's your backend stack?..."

*The AI starts from scratch every session.*

**With AI Context Kit loaded:**
> User: "Help me add authentication to the app."
>
> AI: "Given your SwiftUI codebase and the TCA architecture you're migrating to, I'd model this as a new `AuthenticationFeature` reducer rather than adding it to an existing one. Want me to scaffold the reducer and effect first, or start with the SwiftUI view bindings?"

*The AI already knows your stack, your existing patterns, and your preferences.*

The difference is not magic — it is reduced friction. The AI spends zero turns asking who you are, what you are building, or how you like to work. That adds up significantly across a full development session.

## Core Concepts

### The AGENTS + Skills Distinction

**`AGENTS.md` files** define persistent operational context:
- WHO is collaborating (user/project context)
- WHAT the project scope and constraints are
- HOW collaboration should run (roles, phases, tone, interaction mode)

**`skills/*/SKILL.md` files** define reusable workflows:
- How to create artifacts (for example, AGENTS or user context files)
- How to validate artifacts and report findings
- How to keep workflow logic centralized and auditable

**Day-to-day requests** are task directives executed within that context:
- "Create a new API endpoint"
- "Review this code for security issues"
- "Run the AGENTS validation workflow and list blocking issues"

`prompts/skills/` are composition wrappers that route to canonical skills. `prompts/loop/` contains the numbered implementation loop prompts (readiness-check → implementation → self-review → learnings → human-in-the-loop). Canonical workflow logic lives in `skills/`.

---

## Canonical Authority (Spec v1.5.0)

When guidance differs across files, use this authority order:

1. `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md` (normative)
2. `templates/` (canonical artifact structures)
3. `skills/` (canonical operational workflows)
4. `prompts/skills/` (composition wrappers) and `prompts/loop/` (implementation loop)
5. `usercontexts/` and validation artifacts (illustrative examples)

Canonical template structures live in:
- `templates/usercontext_template.instructions.md`
- `templates/AGENTS_template.md`
- `templates/skill_template/SKILL.md`

These templates are spec-aligned and are the structures expected by canonical create/validate workflows.

### 1. **Personal User Context Instructions**
Your foundational AI context that includes:
- Professional background and current role
- Technical skills and expertise areas
- Active projects and goals
- Preferred working style and communication preferences
- Constraints and limitations

**Purpose:** Serves as the base personal context layer that AI assistants load first to understand who you are and how you work globally.

### 2. **AGENTS.md as Project Context**
Project-level AGENTS.md defines:
- Project scope and objectives
- Technology stack and architecture
- Recommended AI roles (Architect, Developer, Designer, etc.)
- Default work phases (Planning, Implementation, Debugging, Review)
- Project-specific constraints and guidelines

**Purpose:** Provides focused, project-specific operational context layered on top of user context.

### 3. **Session State Model**
Session state is the active set of context values that governs assistant behavior during a working session.

| Element | What It Controls | Default Source | User Modifiable? |
|---------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **User Context** | Identity, preferences, and baseline working style | `*.instructions.md` user context | Rarely (when profile/preferences change) |
| **Project** | Active codebase/domain assumptions and boundaries | Project `AGENTS.md` | Yes |
| **Role/Mode** | Reasoning stance (architecting, implementing, reviewing) | Project defaults in `AGENTS.md` | Yes |
| **Phase** | Current work stage and expected deliverable type | Project defaults in `AGENTS.md` | Yes |
| **Output Style** | Verbosity and response structure | Project defaults in `AGENTS.md` | Yes |
| **Tone** | Communication style | Project defaults in `AGENTS.md` | Yes |
| **Interaction Mode** | Initiative level (`advisory`, `pair`, `driver`) | Project defaults in `AGENTS.md` | Yes |

Note: Interaction Mode is optional in the abstract session model, but project `AGENTS.md` should define a default to keep startup behavior consistent and predictable.

State behavior rules:
- State persists across turns until explicitly changed or reset.
- No silent transitions: project, role, phase, style, tone, and interaction mode must not change implicitly.
- State can be changed with natural language or namespaced commands (for example `/namespace.mode`, `/namespace.phase`, `/namespace.style`, `/namespace.tone`, `/namespace.interact`).
- `/namespace.context` shows current active state; `/namespace.reset` resets session state.

**Purpose:** Keeps behavior consistent, transparent, and aligned as work moves between planning, implementation, debugging, and review.

---

## Agent Skills

This repository provides for reusable **Agent Skills** for authoring and validation.

- Documentation reference: https://agentskills.io/home *(third-party community site for the Agent Skills format — not maintained by this project)*
- Canonical paths:
  - `templates/skill_template/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/`
  - `prompts/` (composition wrappers)

### Skill-First Authority Model
Operational workflow authority is skill-first:
1. `skills/` is the canonical source for create/validate/governance workflow logic.
2. `prompts/` are available as composition wrappers to orchestrate skills.
3. Prompt wrappers should stay concise and must not reintroduce full checklists/rubrics already defined in skills.

### Skill Workflow
1. Author or update workflow behavior in `skills/*/SKILL.md` plus skill-local `references/`.
2. Keep detailed operational logic in skills; use prompts as composition wrappers only.
3. Always validate skills and keep `SKILL.validation.md` current.

> **Validation scope:** Validation scores reflect structural compliance with the spec format as assessed by an AI model against a structured scoring rubric intended to be applied consistently. They do not guarantee real-world session effectiveness or consistent LLM behavior across providers. Treat scores as a structural checklist result, not a quality certification.

### Available Skills
- `skills/create-usercontext-instructions/`
- `skills/create-project-instructions/`
- `skills/create-agents-md/`
- `skills/validate-usercontext-instructions/`
- `skills/validate-project-instructions/`
- `skills/validate-agents-md/`
- `skills/repository-drift-control/`
- `skills/create-skill/`
- `skills/validate-skill/`
- `skills/create-checkpoint/`
- `skills/restore-checkpoint/`
- `skills/time-awareness/`

### Invoking Skills

Skills are invoked by loading the skill's `SKILL.md` content into your AI session. The method varies by platform:

| Platform | How to invoke a skill |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Claude Projects** | Add the `SKILL.md` file to project knowledge, or paste its content into the project instructions field |
| **Claude (web)** | Paste the full `SKILL.md` content at the start of your conversation |
| **VS Code Copilot Chat** | Type `#file:skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` in the chat input to reference the file inline |
| **GitHub Copilot (coding agent)** | Reference or include the `SKILL.md` in your prompt file; the agent reads it as part of its context |
| **ChatGPT** | Paste the content into the chat, or upload the `SKILL.md` as a file attachment |
| **Local API** | Include the `SKILL.md` content in your system prompt when initializing a conversation |

In repo-aware environments (VS Code Copilot Chat with `#file:` access, Claude Projects with full repository knowledge), skill reference files in `references/` subfolders are resolved automatically by the AI when following the workflow. In paste-based or upload-based environments (ChatGPT, local API), attach or include the relevant reference files alongside `SKILL.md` for full workflow coverage.

### Neutrality And Safety
- Skills must remain provider-neutral and runtime-portable.
- Use relative paths for skill-local references.
- Treat tool execution permissions as explicit policy decisions.
- Keep prompt wrappers thin and non-authoritative to avoid logic drift.

---

## File Path Conventions

This repository relies on **stable, predictable file paths** so that AGENTS context, skills, specifications, prompts, and validators can reference each other safely.

The following paths are considered **canonical**:

- `AGENTS.md`
  - Primary agent entrypoint (repo-specific operational contract)
- `templates/`
  - Canonical instruction templates (spec v1.5.0)
- `skills/`
  - Canonical workflow skills (`SKILL.md`-based folders)
- `prompts/`
  - Composition wrappers for instruction/skill workflows
- `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md`
  - Authoritative specification (v1.5.0+)
- Root `README.md`
  - Human-facing entry point and workflow documentation

If paths must change, update the specification and README first, then adjust skills, prompts, and validators accordingly.

## Quick Start

### For First-Time Users

1. **Create Your User Context Artifact**
   - **Manual (canonical):** Copy `templates/usercontext_template.instructions.md`, fill in your details, and save as `yourname_usercontext.instructions.md`
   - **Skill:** Use `skills/create-usercontext-instructions/SKILL.md` to generate your user context file

2. **Create Project AGENTS Context**
   - **Manual (canonical):** Copy `templates/AGENTS_template.md` and define your project context
   - **Skill:** Use `skills/create-agents-md/SKILL.md` (or `skills/create-project-instructions/SKILL.md` where that workflow is preferred)
   - Save as `AGENTS.md` in your project root (or scoped nested `AGENTS.md` where needed)

3. **Validate Artifacts**
   - Use `skills/validate-usercontext-instructions/SKILL.md` for user context files
   - Use `skills/validate-agents-md/SKILL.md` for `AGENTS.md`
   - Use `skills/validate-project-instructions/SKILL.md` when validating project-context `AGENTS.md` artifacts

4. **Load Context Into Your AI Environment**
   - See platform-specific instructions below

### For Returning Users

- Load your user context artifact as the base context
- Add the relevant project `AGENTS.md` context on top
- Use your project's namespaced commands (for example `/ack.context`) to inspect or adjust active session state

---

## Loading Context in Different AI Platforms

| Platform | Method | Limitations / Notes |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Anthropic Claude Projects** | Add user context and `AGENTS.md` to project knowledge or project instructions | Large files compete with conversation history for context window space; keep files concise |
| **GitHub Copilot (VS Code/IDE, coding agent, code review)** | Keep `AGENTS.md` in your project root; Copilot reads it automatically | — |
| **OpenAI ChatGPT** | Paste user context into **Custom Instructions**; upload `AGENTS.md` as a file attachment | Custom Instructions has a tight character limit — long user context files will be silently truncated; maintain a condensed version and consult current OpenAI documentation for the latest limit |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Keep `AGENTS.md` in your project root; Codex reads it automatically | — |
| **Local scripts / APIs** | Concatenate user context + `AGENTS.md` when initializing conversations | Context window management is your responsibility; monitor token usage for long sessions |
| **Other platforms** | Use the platform's context management capabilities (project knowledge, system instructions, or initial prompt injection) | Method and limits vary; consult platform documentation |

---

## Installing as a Plugin

AI Context Kit ships native plugin metadata for Codex and compatibility metadata for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI. Installing registers all 12 skills in the target runtime, with no manual `SKILL.md` loading required.

### OpenAI Codex

Register the repository as a marketplace source:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add MSiccDev/ai-context-kit
```

Then restart Codex, open **Plugins**, choose the **AI Context Kit** marketplace, and install `ai-context-kit`.

This repository also supports repo-scoped skill discovery for direct local use. If you clone the repository and run Codex inside it, the `.agents/skills/` symlinks expose the canonical `skills/` directory without duplicating content.

### Claude Code

Register the marketplace (one-time) and install:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add MSiccDev/ai-context-kit
claude plugin install ai-context-kit@ai-context-kit
```

To install for a specific project only (shared via `.claude/settings.json`):

```bash
claude plugin install ai-context-kit@ai-context-kit --scope project
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

The install commands are identical — the plugin spec is shared:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add MSiccDev/ai-context-kit
copilot plugin install ai-context-kit@ai-context-kit
```

### Test locally before installing

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./path/to/ai-context-kit
```

### Invoking skills after installation

> **Plugin runtime vs. manual invocation:** This section covers invocation when the plugin is installed via the plugin system. If you are using the repository directly (cloned or forked), see [Invoking Skills](#invoking-skills) above, or use Codex repo-scoped skill discovery through `.agents/skills/`.

Skills are namespaced to the plugin name. Inside a session:

```
/ai-context-kit:create-usercontext-instructions
/ai-context-kit:validate-agents-md
```

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `create-usercontext-instructions` | Generate a new user context file through structured discovery |
| `create-agents-md` | Generate a root `AGENTS.md` for any repository |
| `create-project-instructions` | Generate a project-context `AGENTS.md` with role/phase defaults |
| `create-skill` | Generate a new canonical `SKILL.md` artifact |
| `validate-usercontext-instructions` | Validate a user context file with scored report |
| `validate-agents-md` | Validate a root `AGENTS.md` with scored report |
| `validate-project-instructions` | Validate a project-context `AGENTS.md` with scored report |
| `validate-skill` | Validate a `SKILL.md` artifact with scored report |
| `repository-drift-control` | Check and enforce consistency across spec, templates, and docs |
| `create-checkpoint` | Capture session state as a checkpoint artifact (spec section 4.4) |
| `restore-checkpoint` | Restore session state from a checkpoint artifact (spec section 4.4) |
| `time-awareness` | Ground date, time-of-day, elapsed-time, and pacing statements in a real local clock reading |

### Update

```bash
claude plugin update ai-context-kit
```

---

## Using with OpenAI Codex

Codex auto-discovers skills from the `.agents/skills/` directory, scanning upward from the current working directory to the repo root. AI Context Kit ships a `.agents/skills/` directory whose entries are symlinks to the canonical `skills/` folders, so repo-local skill discovery and plugin packaging both point at the same source of truth.

### Auto-discovery (no install needed)

If you clone this repo and run Codex from within it, all 12 skills are discovered automatically. No registration or import is required for repo-local use.

### Invoking skills in Codex

Skills surface as chips in the Codex skill picker. You can also invoke them explicitly:

```
$create-usercontext-instructions
$validate-agents-md
$repository-drift-control
```

`repository-drift-control` requires explicit invocation (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`) since it is a governance action.

### Installing the plugin instead of using repo-local discovery

If you want the skills available outside this repository without copying `.agents/skills/` into each project, install the plugin from the Codex marketplace flow described above.

### Using skills in your own project

To make these skills available when working in a different project without installing the plugin, add the skill path to your Codex configuration, or copy or symlink the `.agents/skills/` directory into your project root.

> **Note for Windows users:** Git symlink support must be enabled **before** checkout — otherwise git materialises symlinks as plain text files. Enable it at clone time:
> ```bash
> git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/MSiccDev/ai-context-kit.git
> ```
> On Windows this also requires Developer Mode or elevated (Administrator) privileges. If you cannot enable symlinks, copy the `skills/` subdirectories into `.agents/skills/` manually as a fallback.

## How It Works

### Context Control

You can modify session state dynamically using:

- **Natural language:** "Switch to Developer Mode" or "Move to Implementation Phase"
- **Commands:** `/namespace.context`, `/namespace.mode`, `/namespace.phase`, `/namespace.style`, `/namespace.tone`, `/namespace.interact`, `/namespace.reset`
- **Command namespace:** Projects define a namespace prefix to avoid collisions (preferred pattern: `/namespace.command`; AI Context Kit uses `/ack.*`)
- **Project defaults:** Each project can define typical starting configurations

### Design Principles

- **Reduced variance:** Same context + same query = more predictable responses that follow consistent conventions and reasoning patterns. LLMs are probabilistic by nature; this means reduced variance, not guaranteed identical outputs.
- **Explicitness:** AI confirms context changes rather than assuming
- **Continuity:** Session state persists across conversation turns
- **Reversibility:** All context changes can be undone
- **Transparency:** Current context is always visible on request

---

## Customization

### Creating Your User Context

The user context file includes both **human-readable system instructions** and **machine-readable JSON metadata**, ensuring compatibility with various AI platforms.

Key sections to customize:
- About (role, location, ecosystem preferences)
- Projects (with platforms and status)
- Skills (categorized by domain)
- Goals and Constraints
- Preferred working style
- Current focus areas

### Creating Project AGENTS Context

Each project `AGENTS.md` should define:
- Project description and tech stack
- Supported AI roles for this project
- Default role and phase
- Phase-specific guidelines
- Output preferences
- Constraints and special considerations

---

## Conventions

- **File format:** UTF-8 Markdown
  - `.instructions.md` for user context files (lowercase with underscores for user contexts (e.g., `yourname_usercontext.instructions.md`))
  - `AGENTS.md` for project-level operational context
  - Day-to-day task requests are what you ask the AI within this context layer
- **Structure:** Consistent headings and sections across all files
- **Languages:** LLMs work best when instructions are in English, but you can include multilingual content in user context if needed (just be aware of potential comprehension issues)
- **Versioning:** Update user context when skills/preferences evolve; update project `AGENTS.md` when phases/objectives change. Ideally, these should live in the same repository as your codebase once they are created.
- **Discoverability:** Semantic file extensions help AI tools identify and load the appropriate instructions automatically
- **Canonical structure:** The templates in `/templates` define the only supported artifact structures for spec v1.5.0

---

## Benefits

### Consistency
- Similar quality of AI assistance across different platforms
- No need to re-explain your background repeatedly

### Efficiency  
- AI understands your context from the start
- Faster onboarding when switching projects
- Less cognitive overhead managing AI interactions

### Adaptability
- AI behavior adjusts to your current work phase
- Easy to switch between different roles (planning, coding, reviewing)
- Context evolves with your projects

### Portability
- Works across multiple LLM providers
- Can be versioned and backed up
- Shareable with team members (with appropriate redactions)

---

## Why This Over Alternatives?

| Approach | What it gives you | What's missing |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Single `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` | Quick, zero-overhead context for one tool | No personal/project separation — the same file covers everything, no cross-tool portability, no structured validation |
| Handwritten system prompt | Full control over phrasing | Re-explained every session, not versionable, not portable |
| Per-project `AGENTS.md` only | Project-specific agent behavior | No personal layer — AI still doesn't know who you are |
| **AI Context Kit** | Layered (personal + project), portable across providers, versioned, validated, skill-reusable | More upfront setup |

**When it pays off:**
- You work across more than one project or AI platform
- You want your personal preferences and stack knowledge to travel with you
- You want a team-shareable, versionable AI workspace configuration
- You want validated, spec-compliant artifacts rather than ad-hoc prompts

**When simpler is better:**
- You use a single tool on a single project and don't plan to change that
- A one-file `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md` already covers your needs

## Getting Started with This Template Repository

> **Recommended: install the plugin** (see [Installing as a Plugin](#installing-as-a-plugin) above). The template repository path below is being phased out — new users should install via plugin instead.

This is a **GitHub template repository**. Here's how to use it:

### Creating Your Own Instance

1. **Use the Template:**
   - Click the green **"Use this template"** button on GitHub
   - Choose **"Create a new repository"**
   - Give it a name (e.g., `my-ai-instructions` or `ai-workspace-config`)
   - **Make it Private** (recommended - it will contain personal information!)
   - GitHub will create a fresh copy for you

2. **Customize Your Instance:**
   - Clone your new repository locally
   - Start with `templates/usercontext_template.instructions.md`
   - Fill in your professional details, skills, and preferences
   - Save as `yourname_usercontext.instructions.md` in the root
   - Create project context from `templates/AGENTS_template.md`
   - Save as `AGENTS.md` in your project root

3. **Keep It Updated:**
   - Update your user context as your skills evolve
   - Version control tracks your AI workspace evolution

### Why Use Template Instead of Fork?

- **Clean history:** Your repository starts fresh without this template's history
- **Private by default:** Easily make your instance private (recommended)
- **No upstream confusion:** It's your repository, not a fork
- **Your data, your control:** Personal instructions stay in your private repo

### Keeping Your Instance Up-to-Date

When the template repository gets improvements, check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed and which files are safe to update.

**Recommended approach — copy files manually:**
1. Open `CHANGELOG.md` in the template repository (browse the upstream source or your local copy if already synced)
2. Read what changed in the new version
3. Copy the updated files listed under **Safe to update** into your instance
4. Commit the changes

**What to update:**
- ✅ Template files in `templates/`
- ✅ Specification documents in `specs/`
- ✅ Skill updates and additions in `skills/`
- ✅ README improvements
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` itself

**What to protect (never overwrite):**
- ❌ Your personal `*_usercontext.instructions.md`
- ❌ Your project `AGENTS.md`
- ❌ Any custom skills you have created

**Advanced: pull specific changes via git**
```bash
# Add the template as a remote (one-time setup)
git remote add template https://github.com/MSiccDev/ai-context-kit.git
git fetch template

# Copy a specific file from the template
git checkout template/main -- specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md

# Or cherry-pick a specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Contributing Back

Found a bug or have an improvement to the **template itself**?

1. Create an issue in the [original template repository](https://github.com/MSiccDev/ai-context-kit)
2. Submit a pull request with improvements to:
   - Template structure
   - Documentation clarity
   - Specification enhancements
   - Example improvements

**Note:** Never contribute your personal user context or project files - keep those private!

- **Phase 2:** Evolved into structured, persistent context management
- **Phase 3:** Matured into a complete instruction-based architecture for AI workspace configuration
- **Phase 4:** Adopting `AGENTS.md` and favoring skills for operational logic to create a more robust, maintainable system

What makes this approach powerful is the shift from treating every AI interaction as isolated to creating **persistent, layered instruction sets** that transform how AI assistants understand and support your work.

This represents lessons learned from extensive work with hosted and local LLM providers and real-world development workflows across multiple projects and domains.
