## Phase 1: Presence, Structure, And Frontmatter

## Phase 2: Field Constraints And Naming Parity
**Status:** ✅ PASS

## Phase 3: Instruction Quality And Completeness
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- Workflow is sequenced correctly: collect → draft → present → approve → write.
- Approval gate is explicit: file must not be written without user confirmation.
- Schema reference is externalised to `references/checkpoint-schema.md`.
- Sensitive data exclusion constraint is explicit.

## Phase 4: Resource References And Safety
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- `references/checkpoint-schema.md` path is relative and resolves correctly.

## Phase 5: Neutrality And Portability
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- Provider-neutral wording throughout.
- Invocation guidance covers all supported platforms.

---

## Summary

### Strengths:
- Strong approval gate prevents silent writes.
- Schema externalisation keeps the workflow file concise.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix):
- None.

### Warnings (Should Fix):
- None.

### Enhancements (Optional):
- Consider a post-write step that suggests adding the checkpoint path to `.gitignore` if the file contains private context.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. Revalidate after any spec section 4.4.2 schema changes.
