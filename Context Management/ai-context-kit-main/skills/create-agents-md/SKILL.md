# Create AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Generate a complete root `AGENTS.md` file that acts as an operational entrypoint while preserving source-of-truth and repository governance rules.

## When To Use
- Use this skill when adding or refreshing repository `AGENTS.md`.
- Use this skill when repository map, precedence, and session controls must be documented concisely.
- Do not use this skill for project/user instruction file generation.

## How to Invoke

Load or attach this file's contents into your AI session to activate the workflow (paste, upload, or reference with `#file:skills/create-agents-md/SKILL.md` in VS Code Copilot Chat). In Claude Projects, add it to project knowledge. See [Invoking Skills](../../README.md#invoking-skills) in the README for full platform guidance.

## Required Inputs
- Repository purpose and canonical paths.
- Source precedence and key references.
- Session-state defaults and command namespace rules.
- Drift-control requirements.

## Workflow
1. Run seven-phase discovery using `references/discovery-phases.md`.
2. Apply required element contract from `references/required-elements.md`.
3. Generate artifact using `references/output-format.md`.
4. Stamp `<!-- spec_version: 1.5.0 -->` as an HTML comment at the top of the generated `AGENTS.md`.
5. Validate result against `references/quality-checklist.md`.
6. Ensure links/paths remain relative and repository-accurate.

## Output Expectations
- One complete root `AGENTS.md` file.
- Includes purpose, precedence, repo map, command policy, and drift-control.
- Uses provider-neutral wording and valid relative links.
- Remains scannable and operationally actionable.
- Output contract and summary format follow `references/output-format.md`.

## Resources
- Discovery workflow: `references/discovery-phases.md`
- Required element contract: `references/required-elements.md`
- Output contract: `references/output-format.md`
- Quality checklist: `references/quality-checklist.md`
- Canonical template: `../../templates/AGENTS_template.md`
- Repository example: `../../AGENTS.md`

## Constraints And Safety
- Do not duplicate full normative specs in AGENTS.
- Preserve canonical path stability.
- Keep guidance deterministic and testable.
- Use relative path references only.
