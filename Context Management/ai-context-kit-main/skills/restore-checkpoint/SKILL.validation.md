# Skill Validation Report

**File:** skills/restore-checkpoint/SKILL.md
**Skill:** restore-checkpoint
**Validated:** 2026-05-12

---

## Overall Status: ✅ PASS

**Compliance Score:** 97/100

---

## Phase 1: Presence, Structure, And Frontmatter
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- SKILL.md exists with valid frontmatter.
- Required fields (`name`, `description`, `version`, `allowed-tools`) are present and syntactically valid.
- `allowed-tools` correctly scoped to `[Read]` — no writes during restore.

### Recommendations:
- None.

---

## Phase 2: Field Constraints And Naming Parity
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- `name` matches folder name and naming constraints.
- Description is trigger-appropriate and limits use to session-start only.

---

## Phase 3: Instruction Quality And Completeness
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- Workflow is sequenced correctly: validate → compare → surface conflicts → resolve → confirm → proceed.
- Confirmation gate is explicit: no task work begins until user confirms restored state.
- Conflict resolution logic and examples are externalised to `references/restore-rules.md`.
- Instruction-file-wins default is explicitly stated.

---

## Phase 4: Resource References And Safety
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- `references/restore-rules.md` path is relative and resolves correctly.
- Cross-reference to `skills/create-checkpoint/references/checkpoint-schema.md` is accurate.
- Mid-session guard is explicit.

---

## Phase 5: Neutrality And Portability
**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Findings:
- Provider-neutral wording throughout.
- Conflict prompt language is platform-neutral (no terminal-specific cues).
- Invocation guidance covers all supported platforms.

---

## Summary

### Strengths:
- Read-only allowed-tools scope is a strong safety constraint.
- Explicit instruction-file-wins default prevents silent state overwrite.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix):
- None.

### Warnings (Should Fix):
- None.

### Enhancements (Optional):
- Consider logging resolved conflicts to a short inline summary the user can copy for their records.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. None.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. Revalidate after any spec section 4.4.3 restore rule changes.
