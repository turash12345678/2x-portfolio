It does not guarantee real-world session effectiveness or consistent LLM behavior across providers. Treat it as a structural checklist result, not a quality certification.

## Summary (Strengths/Critical/Warnings/Enhancements)
### Strengths
- Clear AGENTS-first authority model with explicit precedence.
- Strong operational contract (state, transitions, command namespace).
- High repository alignment and link integrity.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None.

### Warnings (Should Fix)
- None.

### Enhancements (Optional)
- None.

## Recommendations (Immediate + Suggested)
### Immediate
1. No blocking changes required.

### Suggested
1. Keep validation re-runs coupled with future AGENTS structural edits.
2. If section growth continues, split non-operational detail into referenced docs while keeping AGENTS policy-focused.

## Example Fixes for recurring failures
- No recurring failures detected in this run.
