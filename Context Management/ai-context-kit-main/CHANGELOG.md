## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- `time-awareness` skill, workflow step 3: corrected the config key reference back to `recheck.pacing.checkpoints` (it had regressed to the broader `recheck.pacing`, which doesn't itself list the checkpoints); matches `config/time-awareness.config.yaml` and `references/config-schema.md`
- `SKILL.validation.md` for `time-awareness/` updated to match

### Changed
- Bumped `time-awareness` skill `version` `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` (patch: workflow reference fix)
- Version bumped `1.5.0` → `1.5.1` (patch) so the fix is actually distributed: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` all pin an explicit `version`, so Claude Code's plugin update mechanism only ships new content when that string changes — a content-only fix with no version bump would have been invisible to installed users

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- **`time-awareness` skill** — always-on guardrail that grounds date, time-of-day, elapsed-time, and pacing statements in a real local clock reading instead of an estimate, covering time-of-day framing, time-budget drift, stale artifact timestamps, and day-of-week scheduling errors; local time only, no network time service
- `skills/time-awareness/references/config-schema.md` and a user-editable `skills/time-awareness/config/time-awareness.config.yaml` (time-of-day buckets, re-check cadence, trigger phrases)
- `SKILL.validation.md` for `time-awareness/` (PASS, 100/100)
- `.agents/skills/time-awareness` symlink for Codex repo-local discovery
- `skills/README.md` skill inventory expanded with a Runtime Guardrails section (and the previously missing Checkpoint Workflows entries)

### Changed
- Version bumped `1.4.3` → `1.5.0` (minor: new skill). Synced across spec, `docs/spec-rationale.md`, `AGENTS.md`, README, templates, sample artifacts, and all `spec_version` stamps in create/validate skills
- Realigned the three plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) to the shared version — they were left at `1.4.2` by the 1.4.3 doc patch
- README plugin and Codex sections now state 12 skills (was 11)
- `last_updated` set to 2026-09-06 in `specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md` and `docs/spec-rationale.md`
- Refreshed `AGENTS.validation.md` and `usercontexts/sample_usercontext.validation.md` to `spec_version` 1.5.0 (re-validated, still PASS 100/100) so no doc carries a stale version reference

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- Replaced all surviving `deterministic` phrasing (spec §4.1 footnote, §10.8 workflow table; README session state section) with `consistent and predictable` — aligns with the reduced-variance language established in v1.4.2
- Removed stale `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar claim from README Codex section (sidecars were deleted in v1.4.2 but the description was not updated)
- Corrected Copilot platform table row: Copilot Code Review does support `AGENTS.md`; removed incorrect caveat and expanded label to reflect full Copilot coverage
- Replaced `"Works seamlessly"` with honest cross-platform framing that matches the platform-variance caveat already present in the same section
- Added provenance note to `agentskills.io` link — clarifies it is a third-party community site, not a project-maintained resource
- Corrected `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` comparison: `"No layering"` was factually wrong (both support nested files); reframed around the actual gap — no personal/project separation that travels across tools
- Added deprecation callout to template repository section directing new users to the plugin instead

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **`create-checkpoint` skill** — guided workflow to capture session state as a checkpoint artifact per spec section 4.4, with schema reference and `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar
- **`restore-checkpoint` skill** — guided workflow to load, validate, and restore a checkpoint artifact at session start per spec section 4.4 restore rules, with conflict resolution reference and `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar
- **`checkpoint: true` required field** — added to spec section 4.4.2 schema so checkpoint files are self-identifying; restore validation is now fully spec-backed
- AGENTS.md now references sections 4.4 (Cross-Session Persistence) and 4.5 (Context Compression) with explicit behavioral instructions for both
- Prompts and Codex symlinks added for both new skills
- `SKILL.validation.md` added to `create-checkpoint/` and `restore-checkpoint/` skill folders

### Safe to update from template
- `skills/create-checkpoint/` (new)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-11
- **Claude Code plugin** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest makes the repo installable as a native Claude Code plugin; skills are auto-discovered from `skills/`
- **GitHub Copilot CLI plugin** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` turns the repo into a self-hosted marketplace, enabling `copilot plugin marketplace add MSiccDev/ai-context-kit` install flow (Claude Code and Copilot CLI share the same plugin spec)
- **OpenAI Codex support** — `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar added to all 9 skill folders with UI display names, short descriptions, default prompts, and invocation policies for the Codex skill picker
- **`.agents/skills/` discovery directory** — adds a symlink for each skill folder into `.agents/skills/` so Codex auto-discovers skills from its standard path without duplicating content
- `version` and `allowed-tools` fields added to all 9 `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter
- README install sections for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and OpenAI Codex

### Safe to update from template
- `.claude-plugin/` (new directory)
- `.agents/` (new directory)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Spec section 4.4 Cross-Session Persistence** — normative rules for checkpoint artifacts: proposal rules, required schema (project, role, phase, output_style, tone, interaction_mode, open_tasks, key_decisions, active_files, last_updated), and restore/conflict rules
- **Spec section 4.5 Context Compression** — normative rules for managing context window pressure: proposal rules, required compression checkpoint contents, and reversibility requirements
- `docs/spec-rationale.md`: new "Cross-Session Persistence and Context Compression" section with example checkpoint file, conflict resolution dialog, and annotated compression proposal dialog

### Changed
- Spec version bumped from 1.3.1 → 1.4.0 across spec, templates, skills, and all stamped artifacts
- Session Persistence and Context Compression promoted from "Future Enhancements" (rationale doc) to normative spec sections
