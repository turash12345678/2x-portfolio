# Spec Rationale & Extended Reference (v1.5.0)

This document is the companion to [`specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md`](../specs/context_aware_ai_session_spec.md). It contains the background reasoning, extended examples, project profile illustrations, end-to-end scenarios, and future enhancement notes that were removed from the normative spec to keep it readable.

If you need the rules, read the spec. If you need the reasoning or examples, read this.

## Background: Why This Specification Exists

Modern AI assistants often treat each interaction as an independent request without continuity, resulting in frequent misunderstandings, repeated explanations, and incorrect assumptions about the user's goals, role, or current phase of work. In professional environments — especially software development, technical architecture, prompt engineering, and iterative system design — this lack of persistent context reduces effectiveness, trust, and cognitive flow.

This specification introduces a structured **instruction-based session model** in which assistant behavior is consistently governed by a defined set of contextual parameters: Persona, Project, Role, Phase, Output Style, Tone, and Interaction Mode. By shifting from context-free, turn-based interactions to stable, instruction-based reasoning, assistants become more reliable, aligned, and cooperative partners in complex workflows.

The document defines:
- Transition rules, user control methods (via natural language or structured commands), and project-based default configurations
- Real-world multi-phase scenarios demonstrating how the system behaves under different conditions
- Potential future enhancements including automatic phase inference, branch-based project mapping, and context checkpointing

## Extended Session State Examples

The following examples illustrate how the session state elements combine in practice.

| User Context | Project | Role | Phase | Output Style | Tone | Interaction Mode |
|---------|--------|------|-------|--------------|------|------------------|
| Senior software engineer | Mobile UI project | UI Designer | Planning | Annotated conceptual proposals | Friendly & creative | Advisory |
| Data researcher | AI evaluation pipeline | Prompt Engineer | Implementation | JSON-formatted responses | Precise & technical | Execution-focused |
| Backend-focused developer | API service | Developer | Debugging | Minimal patch suggestions | Direct | Pair-programming |

---

## Project Context Profiles

### Example Project Profiles

The following generic profiles illustrate how different project types map to default session configurations:

| Project Type | Default Role | Default Phase | Output Style | Tone | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------|-------|
| Backend API Service | Developer | Implementation | Structured code with brief explanations | Direct | Transitions to Debugging Phase common |
| New Product Concept | Architect | Planning | Exploratory, comparative analysis | Analytical | Focus on trade-offs |
| Prompt Testing Framework | Prompt Engineer | Iterative Testing | JSON or schema-aligned | Precise | Scoring rubric is deterministic |
| Mobile App UI | UI Developer or Designer | Planning or Implementation | Annotated UI concepts or code | User-centered | Often alternates between visuals and code |
| Data Processing Pipeline | Automation Engineer | Design or Implementation | Process flow breakdowns and batch scripts | Technical | Performance considerations important |

### Defaults as Soft Hints — Example

After applying defaults, the assistant should confirm:

```
Detected project: Data Pipeline
Suggested defaults: Role = Automation Engineer, Phase = Planning, Output Style = Analytical
Continue or modify?
```

### Adaptive Defaults (Optional Enhancement)

If a user consistently overrides defaults (e.g., always enters Review Mode first), the assistant may suggest updating defaults. Such updates should require explicit confirmation.

Example:
> "I notice that you often begin this project in Review Mode. Shall I set Review as the new default phase?"

### Lifecycle-Based Defaults

As projects evolve, defaults may shift:

| Project Stage | Default Role | Phase |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Early MVP Design | Architect | Planning |
| Active Feature Development | Developer | Implementation |
| Pre-release | QA Reviewer | Review |
| Post-release Maintenance | Developer or Debugger | Debugging |

On project stage change, the assistant may prompt:
> "The project is now in pre-release review. Switch defaults to Reviewer Mode in Review Phase?"

---

## End-to-End Scenarios

These scenarios demonstrate how the assistant applies session logic across initialization, transitions, and continuation.

### Scenario A — Fresh Session with Project Detection

User opens a chat environment integrated in an IDE, within a repository named `mobile-ui-app`.

```
Assistant: It appears you are working in a project named 'mobile-ui-app'. Would you like to activate this project context?
User: Yes.
Assistant: The suggested default role for this project is UI Developer in the Planning Phase, with structured explanations. Continue or modify?
User: Switch role to Developer but stay in Planning Phase.
Assistant:
  Active Context:
  - Project: mobile-ui-app
  - Role: Developer
  - Phase: Planning
  - Output Style: Structured
  - Tone: Neutral
  Ready to proceed.
```

### Scenario B — Implicit Initialization Triggered by Task Request

```
User: Generate the initial database schema for product reviews.
Assistant: To ensure alignment, should I assume this task belongs to a backend API project, with Developer Role in Implementation Phase?
User: Yes, backend API project, Developer Mode, Implementation Phase. Make the output concise.
Assistant:
  Active Context:
  - Project: backend-api
  - Role: Developer
  - Phase: Implementation
  - Output Style: Concise
  - Tone: Direct
  Now generating schema...
```

### Scenario C — Role Shift Due to Conceptual Change

```
User: Now let's think about how this backend should scale globally before adding more code.
Assistant: This involves higher-level system reasoning. Would you like to switch to Architect Role and return to Planning Phase?
User: Yes, switch.
Assistant:
  Session Context Updated:
  - Project: backend-api
  - Role: Architect
  - Phase: Planning
  I will now provide scaling strategies.
```

### Scenario D — Phase Transition During Development

```
User: We have agreed on the design. Implement the data access layer now.
Assistant: Would you like to switch to Developer Role in Implementation Phase?
User: Yes.
Assistant:
  Session Context Updated:
  - Role: Developer
  - Phase: Implementation
  Beginning implementation.
```

### Scenario E — Output Style Override Without Role Change

```
User: From now on, produce only code responses without explanations.
Assistant: Output Style updated to Minimal Code. I will omit explanations unless explicitly requested.
```

### Scenario F — Full Context Reset and Reinitialization

```
User: Reset the session.
Assistant: Session context has been cleared. User context preferences remain active. Please specify the new project or provide a task to start.
User: We are working on a prompt-testing tool project. Begin in Prompt Engineer Role, Testing Phase, JSON output.
Assistant:
  Active Context:
  - Project: prompt-testing tool
  - Role: Prompt Engineer
  - Phase: Testing
  - Output Style: JSON-focused
  - Tone: Technical
  Proceeding with schema-based validation approach.
```

## Cross-Session Persistence and Context Compression

These features are defined normatively in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the spec. This section provides examples and rationale.

### Session Persistence: Example Checkpoint File

A checkpoint artifact captures the full session state at end-of-session and can be loaded at the start of the next session. Markdown with frontmatter is recommended for human readability; JSON is acceptable for programmatic use.

```markdown
---
checkpoint_version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2026-05-08T21:30:00Z"
project: "Fieldwork"
role: "Developer"
phase: "Implementation"
output_style: "minimal"
tone: "direct"
interaction_mode: "pair"
---

## Open Tasks
- Resolve CloudKit merge conflict in `SyncEngine.mergeRemoteRecord(_:)`
- Add unit tests for `ConflictResolutionPolicy.lastWriterWins`

## Key Decisions
- Chose `lastWriterWins` over `serverWins` for field-data records; rationale: environmental consultants edit offline for days and their local data is authoritative
- Deferred background sync to post-beta; focusing on foreground pull first

## Active Files
- `Sources/Fieldwork/Sync/SyncEngine.swift`
- `Sources/Fieldwork/Sync/ConflictResolutionPolicy.swift`
- `Tests/FieldworkTests/SyncEngineTests.swift`
```

**Restore flow:** At the start of the next session, the user provides the checkpoint file. The assistant reads it, summarizes the restored state, flags any conflicts with the current instruction files, and waits for confirmation before proceeding.

### Session Persistence: Conflict Resolution Example

If the checkpoint says `role: Architect` but `AGENTS.md` defaults to `role: Developer`, the assistant surfaces the conflict:

```
Checkpoint loaded. One conflict detected:

  Checkpoint role: Architect
  AGENTS.md default role: Developer

Which should take precedence for this session?
```

The user resolves it explicitly. Instruction files win by default if the user does not respond.

### Context Compression: When and Why

Context compression becomes relevant when:
- The provider auto-compresses earlier turns (visible when the assistant starts losing reference to earlier discussion)
- The session has accumulated a large number of turns with many file references and decisions
- The user is about to shift to a new sub-task and wants a clean slate that still preserves state

Compression is not a shortcut. It must never silently discard constraints or decisions. The compression checkpoint is a structured summary — not freeform prose — so it can be used as a restore point.

### Context Compression: Example Proposal Dialog

```
Context window is filling. I can compress earlier session content to
free space while preserving what matters. Here is what I would retain:

Session State:
  Project: Fieldwork | Role: Developer | Phase: Implementation
  Output Style: minimal | Tone: direct | Interaction Mode: pair

Active Constraints (from AGENTS.md / user context):
  - No SwiftData in production
  - No third-party networking libraries
  - Tests: business logic only

Key Decisions:
  - Using lastWriterWins conflict policy for field records
  - Background sync deferred to post-beta

Open Tasks:
  - Resolve merge conflict in SyncEngine.mergeRemoteRecord(_:)
  - Add ConflictResolutionPolicy unit tests

Active Files:
  - Sources/Fieldwork/Sync/SyncEngine.swift
  - Sources/Fieldwork/Sync/ConflictResolutionPolicy.swift

What will be dropped: earlier diagnostic exploration of CloudKit
CKSubscription setup (resolved and no longer active).

Save a checkpoint file before compressing? [yes / no / proceed without saving]
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional / Evolutionary)

These enhancements are additive optimizations for future consideration. They must remain optional and should never compromise explicitness, transparency, or user control.

### Automatic Phase Inference
The assistant may observe repeated task patterns and suggest transitioning to a corresponding phase. Any inferred change must be confirmed before activation.
> "You have been requesting multiple code implementations. Should we enter Implementation Phase?"

### Suggested Role Alignment
If a user repeatedly shifts task types, the assistant may recommend a more fitting role.
> "This request aligns more with Developer Mode. Would you like to switch modes?"

### Tone Adaptation Based on User Behavior
Optionally adjust tone based on the user's communication style. Must be opt-in and user-confirmed.

### Multi-Role Comparative Reasoning
In advanced review scenarios, the assistant may offer responses from multiple role perspectives simultaneously.

### Git Branch / Naming Convention Awareness

| Branch Prefix | Likely Phase | Role |
|---------------|-------------|------|
| `feature/*` | Implementation | Developer |
| `design/*` | Planning | Architect |
| `bugfix/*` or `hotfix/*` | Debugging | Developer |

> "You are currently in a branch named `feature/login-ui`. Should I switch to Developer Mode in Implementation Phase?"

### CI/CD and Release Readiness Integration
Near release checkpoints, the assistant may propose transitions to Review or QA modes to support changelog generation or final auditing.

### Lifecycle-Based Default Shifts
As projects move through phases (MVP → development → testing → maintenance), default profiles may adapt with user approval.

### Multi-User Collaboration Extension
Future implementations could support per-user role contexts within a shared project, switching contextual interpretations depending on user identity or prompt attribution.

### UI and Tooling Integration
- Visual dashboards showing current session context
- Quick toggles for role or phase changes
- Command auto-completion
- Visual indicators of context transitions

## Conclusion

This specification establishes a structured, user-aligned framework for how AI assistants should manage, maintain, and evolve session context in complex, project-driven workflows. Rather than treating each interaction as an isolated query, this model enables the assistant to act as a persistent, adaptive collaborator that aligns with the user's intent, role, task phase, and communication expectations.

By defining a formal session state composed of User Context, Project, Role, Phase, Output Style, Tone, and Interaction Mode, this framework ensures continuity, reduces repetitive context setup, and enables more accurate, higher-quality responses over time.

This model is domain-agnostic, implementation-neutral, and compatible with a wide range of environments — from chat-based assistants to IDE extensions, MCP-driven agent systems, and specialized domain workflows.
