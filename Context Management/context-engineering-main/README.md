# Context Engineering ![](https://bonigarcia.dev/img/context-engineering.png)

**Context engineering** can be defined as the practice of designing systems that provide a Large Language Model (LLM) and AI agents with all the necessary information to complete a task effectively. It goes beyond prompt engineering since it focuses on building a comprehensive and structured context from various sources like instructions, external knowledge, memory, tools, and state. The central idea is that the success of a complex LLM-based system depends more on the quality and completeness of the context provided than on the specific wording of the prompt itself.

Tobi Lütke, the CEO of Shopify, coined the term _context engineering_ in a [tweet](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127) on June 19, 2025. He defined context engineering as _the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM_. This novel concept captures the essence of the current evolution of LLM-based systems, inspiring others (like me) to understand and define this emerging discipline. Since then, I've been working on a book entitled **Context Engineering: Build Consistent, Accurate, Predictable AI Systems**, published by Manning. Currently, the early access version of the book is available, and you can get it [here](https://hubs.la/Q04ksQ8J0).

This GitHub repository is intended to be a companion resource for this book and a reference for practitioners looking to understand and adopt the context engineering principles.
