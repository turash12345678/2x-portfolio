# Parlant journey flow

This companion describes Parlant journeys as multi-turn SOPs.
Use them when the conversation needs a structured flow with states and transitions.

## Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.10+
* An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) set as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)

## Steps for running this example in the shell

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows Command Prompt:
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Export your API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # Windows cmd: set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # Windows PowerShell: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python journey_flow.py
```

## What it demonstrates

* Multi-turn conversational paths
* State transitions for step-by-step processes
* A better fit than a single guideline for ordered workflows
