# Structured output with Spring AI and Ollama

This example shows Spring AI returning a typed Java record from a local Ollama model.

It asks for a tiny release summary and maps the JSON output into a record.

## Requirements

* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 21+
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.9+
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed locally
* A pulled chat model such as `llama3.2:1b`

## Steps for running this example in the shell

1. Start Ollama and pull the chat model:
```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Output

```
User: Return a JSON object with title, priority, and nextStep for a release readiness check.
Model: ReleaseSummary[title=Release Readiness Check, priority=High, nextStep=Automated Test]
```
